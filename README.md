Contribute code to any of the scripts available, and request a pull. I will audit to ensure pull removes bugs or increases functionality.

Software will be released openly, however the choice of license is still under consideration. Once considered stable and "complete" as a release, I will switch license over to an open source license. I only ask the work is attributed accordingly. All content contributors will be listed on the site and here for their work. A donation for the overall project will be accepted and appreciated to help support working hours put into development.
